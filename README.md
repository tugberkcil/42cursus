## üó£Ô∏è About 42
 
     A global education effort called 42 proposes a new approach to teaching technology: 
     peer-to-peer learning, without teachers or classrooms,and a system that fosters both 		
     computer and life skills. For anyone is accepted in its selection process, the 42 cursus 
     is free. The final step in the selection process to become a "cadet" (Student 42) 
     is the 26-day C programming bootcamp known as "C Piscine."

\* For further information about 42's **selection process** (the "Piscine"), please visit the [C Piscine repo](https://github.com/tugberkcil/ecole42-piscine).

### Soft-skills

# Self-learning and proactiveness

    The foundation of its peer-to-peer learning methodology, at 42, 
    is self-learning. There aren't any teachers at all; instead, students 
    learn at their own pace while using Google, talking to their peers, and 
    empirical information.

# Teamwork

    Weekend team projects called "Rush" need a three-person team to co-create 
    a fully functional application. This project lasts for 48 hours. Equalizing 
    the various expertise levels while identifying a standard work style that enables 
    all team members to contribute to the project is the main problem here.

# Time management and resiliency

    The school is open twenty-four hours a day. As a result, the so-called "pisciners" 
    are free to work whenever they choose, which necessitates strong time management 
    abilities and resilience to avoid "drowning" under the enormous amount of work 
    required by the nonstop 26-day program.

## üåå 42's galaxy (curriculum)

**42cursus** comprises two groups of projects: the first one being known as _"inner circle"_ and the second one, _"outer treks"_ - due to the **Holy Graph** layout (see image below).

The **inner circle** is the basic curriculum, with all projects being mandatory to attain level 7 - which is the minimum level required for activities such as internships and interchange.

The **outer treks** is a collection of diverse project trails in subjects ranging from operational systems to web development which allows cadets to specialize on whatever subject they prefer.
